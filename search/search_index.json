Much better!</p> <p>It used to cost considerable time and effort to build simulations of working systems that show how data flows through architectures.  But with the rise of low-cost generative AI systems, this is all starting to change.  Now, even teachers are building simulations customized to each lesson, each group and each student.</p> <p>Our goal in this project is to build a foundation of architecture simulations that span many levels of abstraction.  At the bottom of these abstractions are digital logic gates.  At the top level, we have complete applications.  And there are many layers in between.</p> <p>We have used generative AI, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-4 to generate the first pass at many of these simulations.  We have then manually adjusted the simulations to make them correct, consistent and reusable.  You should be able to use generative AI to quickly customize them for new tasks.</p> <p>Speaking of reuse, all of the content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons.
