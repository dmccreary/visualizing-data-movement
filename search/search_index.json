Static architectural diagrams suck.</p> <p>To be specific:</p> <ol> <li>They often don't really explain what is happening in a system.</li> <li>They don't help users understand where data flow bottlenecks occur in systems.</li> <li>They don't show us where single-point-of-failures occur in a system.</li> <li>They are not good at helping us understand the architectural tradeoffs of different designs.</li> </ol> <p>In short, we can do better.  Much better!</p> <p>It used to cost considerable time and effort to build simulations of working systems that show how data flows through architectures.  But with the rise of low-cost generative AI systems, this is all starting to change.  Now, even teachers are building simulations customized to each lesson, each group and each student.</p> <p>Our goal in this project is to build a foundation of architecture simulations that span many levels of abstraction.  At the bottom of these abstractions are digital logic gates.  At the top level, we have complete applications.  And there are many layers in between.</p> <p>These simulations are designed to be used in both classrooms as well as by solution architects and database developers.</p> <p>We have used generative AI, specifically OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT-4 to generate the first pass at many of these simulations.  We have then manually adjusted the simulations to make them correct, consistent and reusable.  You should be able to use generative AI to quickly customize them for new tasks.</p> <p>Speaking of reuse, all of the content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons.  This means you can use the simulations in your classrooms without charge, but you can't resell these programs for profit.  We hope you give this site the appropriate attribution.</p>"},{"location":"about/#related-sites","title":"Related Sites","text":"<p>The Visualizing Data Movement project builds on several other related projects that also focus on building simulations and animations of the world around us.
