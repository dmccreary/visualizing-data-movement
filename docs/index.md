# Visualizing Data Movement

![](img/cover.png)

Welcome to the visualizing data movement website.

This site contains animations of data moving through computer systems.  It includes animations from many
levels:

1. Chip
2. Digital logic gates
3. Computer architecture
4. Memory system
5. Networks
6. Databases
7. Applications

My hope is these animations will help take the
"magic black box" impression that many students
have about computers and allow them to better analyze
existing systems and design new systems.

Please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/) if you have any suggestions or
feedback.  We love to accept your ideas on new animations.
